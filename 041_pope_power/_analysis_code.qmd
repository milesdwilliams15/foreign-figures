## Data

I asked ChatGPT to help me find questions about foreign policy in the survey data. Here's the prompt I gave it:

I'm giving you a pdf. It is a codebook from the 2024 ANES. Identify for me any and all questions that deal with attitudes toward foreign policy issues or positions and summarize them in a bulleted list.

Here's what it gave me:

## 🗒️ Answer

The ANES 2024 Time Series Codebook includes several questions related to foreign policy attitudes and positions. Below is a summary of those questions:

* **U.S. support for Ukraine**

  * Attitudes toward giving weapons to help Ukraine fight Russia (FORPOL\_UKRAINE, FORPOL\_UKRAINESTR).

* **Military aid to Israel**

  * Favor or oppose U.S. military assistance to Israel and strength of that support (FORPOL\_ISRAEL, FORPOL\_ISRAELSTR).

* **Humanitarian aid to Gaza**

  * Favor or oppose U.S. humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and strength of that support (FORPOL\_GAZA, FORPOL\_GAZASTR).

* **Protests against the war in Gaza**

  * Approval of college campus protests against the war (FORPOL\_GAZAPROTEST, FORPOL\_GAZAPROTESTSTR).

* **Middle East conflict alignment**

  * Respondent’s alignment with Israelis or Palestinians (FORPOL\_ISRPAL, FORPOL\_ISRPALSTR).

* **Perceived threats from foreign countries**

  * How much of a threat respondents believe various countries pose to the U.S., including China, Russia, Mexico, Iran, Japan, and Israel (FRGNTHRT\_\[COUNTRY]).

* **Foreign policy approval of President**

  * Approval of Joe Biden’s handling of foreign relations (PRESAPP\_FRNPRES, PRESAPP\_FRNPRESST).

* **U.S. military intervention globally**

  * Willingness to use military force to solve international problems (USWORLD\_MILFORCE).

* **U.S. isolationism**

  * Agreement with the idea that the country would be better off “just staying home” (USWORLD\_USISOL, USWORLD\_USISOLSTR).

* **Free trade agreements**

  * Attitudes toward the U.S. making free trade agreements with other countries (FREETRADE\_AGRMT, FREETRADE\_AGRMTSTR).

* **Worry about terrorism**

  * Concern about a terrorist attack in the near future (TERROR\_TERRWORRY).

Alright, read in the data and make some recodes. I won't look at all of these issues. I'll just pick out 3.

```{r}

## read in the data:
dt <- read_csv(
  here(
    "_data",
    "anes_timeseries_2024_csv_20250430.csv"
  )
)

## Refine!
dt |>
  transmute(
    catholic = ifelse(
      V241422 == 2, 1, 0
    ),
    ukraine_aid = frcode(
      V241400x %in% 5:7 ~ "Oppose",
      V241400x == 4 ~ "Neutral",
      V241400x %in% 1:3 ~ "Support"
    ),
    pal_aid = frcode(
      V241406x %in% 5:7 ~ "Oppose",
      V241406x == 4 ~ "Neutral",
      V241406x %in% 1:3 ~ "Support"
    ),
    us_force = frcode(
      V241313 == 5 ~ "Not at all",
      V241313 == 4 ~ "A little",
      V241313 == 3 ~ "Moderately",
      V241313 == 2 ~ "Very",
      V241313 == 1 ~ "Extremely"
    )
  ) -> sdt
```


## Figures

First, just tabulate the share of the data that's catholic:

```{r}
sdt |>
  ct(catholic)
dim(sdt)
```

Now break down support for issues for everyone and compare Catholics to the average.

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 6

sm <- function(dt, var) {
  dt |>
    ct(!!enquo(var), show_na = F) -> all
  dt |>
    mutate(
      catholic = ifelse(
        catholic == 1,
        "Catholic",
        "Non-Catholic"
      )
    ) |>
    group_by(catholic) |>
    ct(!!enquo(var), show_na = F) -> grp
  bind_rows(
    all |> mutate(catholic = "Everyone"),
    grp
  )
}
